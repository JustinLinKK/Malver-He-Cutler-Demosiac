#  Malver-He-Cutler & linear regression algorithm  
    This two algorithms is used to demosaic the bayer pattern image   

## Get Started ðŸš€  
    Install the pytorch

# MATLAB Linear Regression Model

## Introduction
    The linear Regression Model takes the 5x5 pixels mosaic patch as the input and predict the missing color channels in the center pixel. 
    The precision can be imporved by increase the patch size or the dataset size

## Build the training dataset  
    Put the RGB images for training in the train folder. 
    The image should be in the png format. 
    Run the datasetPreparation.m in the matlab.
    The dataset should create as the dataset.mat file.
    
## Train the model coefficient
    Run the training model use the train.m
    The model should save as the coefficients.mat file.

## Run the test on selsted image
    Open the test.m and change the test image file name
    Run the test.m
